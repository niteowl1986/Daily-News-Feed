       "  'Content': 'Since his recent return to power, Fico has expressed a desire to maintain positive relations with both Ukraine and Russia. While reaffirming Slovakia s support for Ukraine s EU integration and the continuation of gas transit through Ukraine s pipeline network, Fico also hinted at the possibility of improving ties with Russia. This comes at a time when most EU leaders have distanced themselves from the Russian government due to its aggressive actions in Ukraine. Fico, however, appears to be testing whether Slovakia can pursue a more balanced foreign policy, maintaining ties with both Kyiv and Moscow. In a recent informal meeting between Slovakia s Foreign Minister and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, some observers saw an attempt to gauge public and international reactions to the Slovak government s potential reengagement with Moscow. Fico s stance has been interpreted as an effort to navigate Slovakia s energy dependencies and geopolitical alliances, balancing between Western support for Ukraine and the ongoing need for energy resources, which have historically come from Russia. Energy policy remains a significant factor in Slovakia s relations with Russia. Slovakia has long been dependent on Russian gas, and Gazprom has played a crucial role in the country s energy security since the 1990s. Many political figures in Slovakia built their careers on maintaining good relations with Moscow, especially in the energy sector. Despite Gazprom s reduced role in Europe due to the EU s efforts to diversify energy sources and the company s declining financial fortunes, Slovakia s energy dependency on Russia persists. Fico has shown no sign of shifting away from this dependence, instead appearing to double down on energy ties with Moscow. This position contrasts with broader EU efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy in response to the geopolitical tensions caused by Russia s actions in Ukraine. Fico s approach is likely to raise concerns among Slovakia s European partners. The EU and NATO have consistently condemned Russia s annexation of Crimea and its military involvement in Ukraine, which they regard as violations of international law and sovereignty. Fico s potential participation in Russia s Victory Day celebrations could be perceived as a departure from Slovakia s commitment to the Western bloc s unified stance on Russia. Most EU leaders have avoided official contact with the Kremlin, with only Hungary s Viktor Orb n maintaining a more open line of communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Fico s decision to attend such a highprofile event could be seen as aligning Slovakia with Hungary s more Russiafriendly approach, which has drawn criticism from other EU member states. This has raised questions about the implications for Slovakia s standing within the EU and NATO, where there is strong support for Ukraine and broad opposition to Russia s actions. Slovakia s role in providing military support to Ukraine further complicates the situation, as the country manufactures weapons used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in their defence against Russian aggression. Fico s plan to visit Russia for Victory Day has also provoked reactions within Slovakia, particularly given the country s historical experience with both Nazi occupation during World War II and Soviet domination in the aftermath. In 1944, Slovak citizens took part in an uprising against Nazi forces, and in 1968, the country resisted the Sovietled Warsaw Pact invasion during the Prague Spring. Fico s critics have questioned the appropriateness of the Prime Minister attending an event alongside a leader seen by many as challenging the postwar international order. Russia s actions in Ukraine, including the 2014 annexation of Crimea, have drawn comparisons to Nazi Germany s annexations in the 1930s. In both cases, the aggressor violated international law by altering borders through force or manipulation. Fico s participation in Moscow s Victory Day celebrations could be interpreted as downplaying the importance of international law and the postWorld War II order, which established the principle of respect for national borders and sovereignty. The broader question is how Slovakia s foreign policy under Fico will evolve, particularly in relation to its EU partners. Fico s populist approach and emphasis on maintaining good relations with Russia could risk isolating Slovakia within the EU, where most members have adopted a firm stance against Moscow. The potential shift in Slovakia s foreign policy could complicate its relations with Western allies, particularly if Fico s government is perceived as moving closer to Russia. While Fico may be modelling his approach on Viktor Orb n s balancing act between the West and Moscow, it remains unclear whether Slovakia will be able to maintain such a position without facing pushback from its EU and NATO partners. Orb n has managed to maintain his relationship with Putin while avoiding full alignment with Russia, but Fico s participation in an event like Victory Day could place Slovakia in a more difficult position.

       "  'Content': 'October 7, 2024 Koushik Roy  The housing finance sector is currently experiencing significant growth, evidenced by a quarteronquarter (QoQ) increase of %, translating to an impressive annualized growth rate of % in home loans outstanding. As interest rates are anticipated to decline further, this growth trajectory is expected to accelerate, making it a prime opportunity for both investors and homebuyers.  View Full Image    The positive trends in home loans have resulted in a notable rerating of pricetobook (PB) ratios across the sector. Among the 15 largest listed housing finance companies, 13 have seen their PB ratios increase, signaling heightened market confidence in the growth prospects of the housing finance industry.  View Full Image    Despite the optimism, there are evident disparities among housing finance companies (HFCs) when compared to banks and nonbanking financial companies (NBFCs). These differences arise from various competitive factors such as loan sizes (below  25 lakh,  2550 lakh, and above  50 lakh), funding costs, and risk assessment capabilities. While banks often benefit from lower funding costs, they may lack efficiency in servicing some segments, especially in the affordable housing sector.  Utilizing the National Housing Bank (NHB) definition, which classifies housing loans below  25 lakh as affordable, Aavas Financiers is a prominent leader in this sector, despite some recent challenges. The company has struggled over the past two years, but signs indicate that the worst is now behind it, paving the way for potential recovery.  GNPA is a critical metric indicating loans overdue for more than 90 days. In the housing finance landscape, actual losses tend to be low due to the security provided by property backing the loans. However, high GNPA can stifle growth by adversely affecting an HFC s credit rating, which in turn limits borrowing capacity and diminishes competitiveness.  View Full Image    Although the GNPA challenge is less pronounced in housing finance compared to microfinance, where unsecured loans can lead to severe problems, it still remains a concern. Notably, Aavas Financiers has managed to maintain superior asset quality compared to its peers across different market cycles.  Return on Equity (ROE) is a vital barometer of profitability, with 15% generally deemed healthy. Within the six major players in affordable housing finance, Aavas Financiers exhibits the lowest ROE for FY24, likely attributed to its lower yield rates compared to competitors such as Aptus Value Housing and Home First. Additionally, Aavas faces challenges related to the highest operating expenditure as a percentage of total assets among its peers, coupled with sluggish profit after tax (PAT) growth.  View Full Image    PAT growth has not kept pace with competitors for Aavas Financiers over the past four years. The leadership transition from Kedaara Capital to CVC Capital may have influenced this underperformance, resulting in uncertainty regarding future asset quality under the new leadership of CEO Sachin Bhinder.  View Full Image    Over the last four months, the PB ratios for all affordable housing finance companies have increased sharply. Aavas Financiers, currently valued at x, ranks fourth among its competitors. While this ranking may suggest relative stability, it reflects broader concerns with management changes, modest PAT growth, and lower ROE figures.  View Full Image    Despite these challenges, there are signs of operational improvements with the operating expense to assets ratio decreasing from % to % between FY23 and Q1FY25. Additionally, sectorwide support initiatives, such as the  10 lakh crore central assistance in the PMAY budget and potential upcoming rate cuts, will likely bolster both the sector and Aavas Financiers in the future. The precise impact of these changes remains to be seen, yet optimism is present.

       "  'Content': 'Myinvestmentideas.com Best Investment Plans in India and Money Saving Ideas Home   NCDs Edelweiss Financial Services is coming up with NCD issue that would open for subscription on October 7, 2024. Edelweiss Financial Services is a leading investment banking company which has diversified businesses across retail, corporate credit, wealth management, etc. NCD interest rates are up to 11%. These NCDs are offered for the tenure of 24 months, 36 months, 60 months and 120 months. Interest on these NCDs is paid either monthly, yearly or on maturity depending on the option chosen by an investor. Should you invest in Edelweiss Financial Services NCD Oct2024 issue? What are the risk factors one should consider before investing in such high risk NCDs? Table of Contents This investment banking company, through its subsidiaries has diversified its businesses to include credit, including retail and corporate credit, wealth management, asset management, asset reconstruction and insurance including life and general insurance businesses, which are conducted through its subsidiaries.  Here are the NCD issue details. Let us review the positive factors in this NCD issue. 1) This NCD offers attractive interest rates where investors can get interest up to 11% per annum. 2) It issues secured NCDs. Secured NCDs are always safe compared to unsecured NCDs. In case a company gets windupshut down for some reason, secured NCD investors would get preference in repayment of capital along with interest as those backed up by assets of the company. 3) These NCDs are rated as   CRISIL AWatch Negative (placed on  Rating Watch with Negative Implications ). NCD instruments with this rating are considered to have adequate degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry a low credit risk. 4) Investors have an opportunity to lock their investments with investments at higher interest rates. 5) These NCD bonds are listed on stock exchanges, hence one can sell them based on the availability of the buyers. Let us review some of the negative factors or risk factors in this NCD issue. 1) While Company NCD ratings are AWatch Negative, CRISIL has downgraded these ratings from AAStable to A in 2023 and now to AWatch Negative. 2) NCD s of Series IX and XII have redemption of capital amounts in staggered manner. Means investors would get the principal amount in installments. 3) High levels of customer defaults and the resultant nonperforming assets could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and future financial performance. 4) Refer Edelweiss Financial Services October24 NCD prospectus for complete risk factors. These NCD s offer high interest rates. Though banks have increased the FD interest rates in the last few quarters, they are still low compared to the interest rates offered in these NCDs. These NCDs are rated as CRISIL AWatch Negative. Also, secured NCD bonds are relatively safer compared to unsecured bonds while risk is not 100% eliminated. On the other hand, last year these NCD credit ratings were downgraded and such ratings can change in the future too. In the last 5 years, company revenues have fallen and margins were shrinking, however, started regaining from FY23 onwards. One should not forget about some of the NBFC companies defaulted on NCD payments earlier and some NBFCs delaying NCD repayments in the last few years. High risk investors who understand all these risk factors can invest in these NCDs. Your email address will not be published.

Inflation Under Pressure: What to Expect from the RBI s Upcoming Policy Review The banking sector is closely monitoring the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee s (MPC) review meeting scheduled for October 79. Analysts largely anticipate that the ratesetting panel will maintain the current key policy rates, reserving potential rate cuts for later in the year. However, several recent developments could significantly impact this decision. Despite the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation remaining below the 4% threshold for the past two months, the RBI is expected to hold off on any decisive actions until September and October inflation data is available. This caution arises from persistent food prices, which are still in double digits. In summary, the upcoming RBI Monetary Policy Committee meeting will be pivotal, with global and domestic factors creating a complex landscape for decisionmaking. As the committee navigates these challenges, stakeholders will be keenly watching for insights into how these dynamics shape future monetary policy in India. Strive for tech news and insights?

       "  'Content': 'Diplomacy Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said in the last fivesix years his government saw far more regional integration in the Indian Subcontinent than they witnessed in the years since the partition of India. While responding to a question during the Sardar Patel Lecture on Governance organised by the IC Centre for Governance in New Delhi on Saturday, the Indian External Affairs Minister highlighted connectivity with Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar with road and railway links. Jaishankar also said their refineries give fuel to Nepal and Bangladesh. He said India is pursuing  neighbourhood first  policy and as a big country, it must put in maximum resources. Talking about why a SAARC meeting has not happened in recent years, Jaishankar said that does not mean regional activities have stopped. \"In fact, in the last 56 years, we have seen far more regional integration in the Indian subcontinent,\" he added. India remains firm on its stance of not holding bilateral talks with Pakistan until it puts an end to crossborder terrorism. Jaishankar also indirectly criticised Pakistan, blaming it for the lack of progress in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). \"At the moment, SAARC is not moving forward, we haven\\'t had a meeting of SAARC for a very simple reason there is one member of SAARC who is practising crossborder terrorism at least against one more member of SAARC, maybe more...,\" he said. Jaishankar said terrorism is something which is unacceptable and  despite a global view of it, if one of our neighbours continues to do it there cannot be business as usual in SAARC.  Bangladesh s Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus recently called for the revival of SAARC as a top platform for regional cooperation in South Asia. \"Reviving SAARC could be a good way to start it and seek Pakistan s support,\" he said when he met Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters. Jaishankar said there are no plans to engage in talks with Pakistan during his upcoming visit to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting. The Indian minister stressed that his trip to Pakistan will be purely for the SCO summit. \"Yes, I am scheduled to go to Pakistan in the middle of this month and that is for the meeting of the SCO the heads of government meeting,\" he said Jaishankar also addressed the likely media attention surrounding the visit due to the nature of IndiaPakistan relations. \"I expect that there would be a lot of media interest because the very nature of the relationship is such and I think we will deal with it. But, I do want to say it will be there for a multilateral event, I mean I am not going there to discuss IndiaPakistan relations,\" he said. He said he is going there to be a good member of the SCO.  Since I am a courteous and civil person, I will behave myself accordingly.  Jaishankar said this year\\'s SCO summit is being hosted in Islamabad, as Pakistan, like India, recently joined the organisation. \"Normally, the Prime Minister goes to the highlevel meeting, the heads of state, that s in line with the tradition. It so happens that the meeting is taking place in Pakistan, because, like us, they are a relatively recent member,\" he said. More News Diplomacy Bangladesh has expressed \"deep concern\" over the new arrivals of Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals in recent times due to armed conflicts in Myanmar particularly in Rakhine State. Bangladesh also stressed the need for early, voluntary, and sustainable repatriation of the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals to their homeland. Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin conveyed this when Ambassador of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar to Bangladesh Kyaw Soe Moe met him at Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday. He urged to take all measures to contain armed conflict near the bordering areas of Bangladesh and infiltration of inhabitants and armed personnel from Myanmar into Bangladesh. The Ambassador assured that repatriation of the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals in Myanmar will be commenced as soon as peace and order in Rakhine state are restored, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Both sides acknowledged the huge potentials of cooperation between the two countries in the areas like trade, shipping connectivity, energy, and agriculture. Issues of other bilateral components between the two countries were discussed at the meeting. Ambassador Moe congratulated the Foreign Secretary for assuming the new position and wished that during his tenure the existing bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Myanmar will be further strengthened. The Foreign Secretary also congratulated him on his appointment as the Ambassador. Diplomacy Foreign ministry\\'s Maritime Affairs Unit (MAU) secretary Rear Admiral (retd) Md Khurshed Alam has resigned from his post. The ministry\\'s Public Diplomacy Wing director general, Toufique Hasan, confirmed the decision to BSS Sunday evening. Khurshed Alam represented Bangladesh in the dispute concerning the delimitation of the maritime boundary between Bangladesh and Myanmar at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) in Germany. He also represented the country in the Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary Arbitration between Bangladesh and India under the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. Khurshed had been elected as the president of the 26th session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) Council on 1 October 2020. Diplomacy Foreign Secretary Md Jashim Uddin is scheduled to make an official visit to the United States on 714 October to hold a series of meetings as the two sides eye stronger relations in diverse areas. He is scheduled to leave Dhaka shortly after Sunday midnight, a senior official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told UNB on Sunday. This is going to be his first official visit abroad since his appointment as the foreign secretary. Jashim Uddin will have meetings with senior officials of the US government, a diplomatic source told UNB, adding that he would visit both Washington and New York. He plans to have meetings with officials at the US Department of State, Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR), UN officials in New York, and the officials of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus visited the US recently to attend the United Nations General Assembly and on the sidelines, he had meetings with US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony J Blinken. In New York, President Biden and Prof Yunus affirmed the close partnership between the United States and Bangladesh, which is rooted in shared democratic values and strong peopletopeople ties. President Biden welcomed further engagement between the two governments and offered continued US support as Bangladesh implements its new reform agenda. Diplomacy The government has cancelled the appointment of Mohammad Khorshed Alam Khastagir as Bangladesh s next ambassador to Poland reportedly for his role during the studentsled protests. A foreign ministry source confirmed the development to UNB on Sunday, noting that Khastagir will continue his current role in the Bangladesh Mission in Kuala Lumpur as its Minister (Political) and Deputy High Commissioner at the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. On 25 September, the government announced his name as the new Ambassador to Poland. Khastagir, who is now in Malaysia, was not, however, given a scope to defend him against the allegations brought against him, said the source. Khastagir, a career diplomat belonging to the 20th batch of BCS (Foreign Affairs) cadre, joined Bangladesh Foreign Service in 2001. Prior to joining his current assignment in October 2020, he served as the DirectorDirector General of Europe and EU Wing and International Organisations Wing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (20152019). In his diplomatic career, Khastagir also served as First Secretary at the Bangladesh Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York (20082010) and as Charge d\\'affairesCounsellor at the Bangladesh Embassy in Muscat, Oman (20112014). Khastagir obtained an interdisciplinary Master of Marine Management (Law and Policy) degree from the Dalhousie University, Canada, under the CIDA Marine Scholarship Program (20042005). Earlier, he graduated from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. He also attended several professional development coursestraining programs both at home and abroad. Editor: Md Rezaul Karim   2024 Daily Sun',\n",

The company has developed a medical device that uses cold plasma to provide better wound care. With their PLASOMA solution, up to two and a half times more wounds can be healed than in standard wound care. These results were recently achieved in a clinical study showing the efficacy of their product in complex wounds.  We are immensely proud and grateful for the many votes we received from our network over the past few weeks,  said CEO Bjorn Sprengers.  We were extra proud after hearing the jury report that described the great impact our solution can have on the lives of people with chronic wounds. The judges also recognized the huge savings in healthcare costs we helped realize.  Sprengers sees the award as an important recognition for the team and an important benchmark for the healthcare industry because of the potential that PLASOMA can deliver.  Wound care is a big part of healthcare systems and costs. Typically, two to four percent of healthcare costs in a market go to wound care. We have shown that we can cure two and a half times more of these wounds than standard care, which was a huge milestone for us. Plasmacure offers exciting innovation and technology to stimulate the natural healing process and reduce costs because patients no longer need help 2 or 3 times a week. So you can save all those costs and, most importantly, increase the productivity of nurses and healthcare organizations.  Sprengers hopes that will also lead to action by insurers.  We sincerely hope that this award will be an incentive for insurers, hospitals, and home care agencies in the Netherlands and abroad to work with us and take wound care to the next level together.

Defender Van Dijk and the Reds defence kept another clean sheet in Saturday s 10 win at Crystal Palace to keep them top of the table heading into the international break. The Dutch international is keen for Arne Slot s side to stay there and told Liverpool s website:  We want to improve, we want to challenge, we want to compete until the final day and win and be successful.  That s what we re focusing on   not what other expectations are. We ve got a lot of points until now but we want to have a lot more.  We know how tough the fixture list will be after the international break but why not enjoy it? I m really looking forward to that and hopefully everyone involved with Liverpool is as well.  Liverpool s defence has been key to their success this year, conceding just two Premier League goals so far. However, goalkeeper Alisson suffered a hamstring injury and is expected to miss the Anfield clash with Chelsea on October 20. Speaking about the Reds  rearguard, Van Dijk added:  Obviously we keep going, we keep working and we re never satisfied. We always can improve.  I think today we needed Ali twice, three times maybe, and that s what we re trying to avoid. But if we have to defend, we have to defend with everything that we ve got.  Everyone is contributing to clean sheets but I m very happy with a clean sheet as well.  We want to improve, we want to challenge, we want to compete until the final day and win and be successful. Diogo Jota scored the only goal against Palace, who extended their winless run to seven matches. The Eagles were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty after a tug by Van Dijk on Marc Guehi in the box. Manager Oliver Glasner said:  Why didn t VAR give it? They thought it wasn t a penalty. This situation isn t a discussion for me. It s not like handball or not. Guehi wants to go for the ball and is held by two hands, it influences his run, pulls him down.  I don t know why it wasn t given   and I have read the explanation.

Francesco Farioli s team won thanks to goals scored by Davy Klaassen, Wout Weghorst, and Chuba Akpom.   Date: .2024     Photographer:  The match in the Johan Cruijff ArenA started with both teams looking for chances. The first chances for Ajax came via Mika Godts, who saw his attempts go wide or blocked by FC Groningen s goalkeeper Etienne Vaessen. The first dangerous attempt was made by Kenneth Taylor, who received the ball after the goalkeeper stopped Godts  ball. His attempt hit the post. In the 21st minute, Ajax managed to find the net. None other than Mr. 10, Davy Klaassen, was responsible for the opening goal. He scored after profiting from a rebound after Brian Brobbey saw his attempt blocked. The lastnamed player spent the rest of the first half looking for an opportunity to score but failed to do so.  After the break, Ajax immediately started pressing again. Again, Brian Brobbey did not manage to find the net. Other chances were for Kenneth Taylor and Bertrand Traor . In the 70th minute, FC Groningen scored the equaliser via Jorg Schreuders. He benefitted from a mistake made by Josip  utalo, which allowed him to get past Remko Pasveer. In the next 15 minutes, Francesco Farioli substituted three players. Anton Gaaei, Chuba Akpom and Wout Weghorst came on to bring fresh energy to the team. All three of them ended up being involved in the game s last two goals. In the 91st minute, Wout Weghorst scored his first goal in the Ajax jersey, causing an explosion of relief among the fans present in the Johan Cruijff ArenA. Anton Gaaei gave the assist. Three minutes later, Chuba Akpom scored the 31, with Wout Weghorst giving the assist. The lastminute victory ensured three points for the Amsterdambased team.

       "  'Content': 'Currently rated  by 1 person While standard pasteurization can reduce the H5N1 virus in milk, this study shows that some virus strains remain resilient, calling for further testing to ensure safety in commercial milk supplies. Research Letter: Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Resilience in Milk after Thermal Inactivation. Image Credit: Lik Studio  Shutterstock In a recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers evaluated the resilience of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in milk under pasteurizationlike temperatures and assessed the effectiveness of thermal inactivation. H5N1 influenza is enzootic in many bird populations and can infect mammals, including humans, leading to severe or fatal outcomes in some cases. The detection of H5N1 virus in United States (U.S.) dairy cows has raised significant public health concerns. Pasteurization, a widely used method to ensure milk safety, involves heating milk to eliminate harmful bacteria. In the U.S., lowtemperature longtime (LTLT) and hightemperature shorttime (HTST) pasteurization are common processes. However, recent studies have shown conflicting results regarding the efficacy of pasteurizationlike conditions, indicating that unpasteurized milk from H5N1infected cows may contain sufficient virus to infect susceptible animals. These findings highlight the potential risk to human health, and further research is needed to fully understand the virus\\'s resilience and improve safety measures. Researchers evaluated the effects of different temperatures on influenza virus viability in milk. It is important to note that the test tube conditions used in the experiment do not precisely replicate actual pasteurization processes in the dairy industry, and this presents a key limitation of the study. Four influenza virus strains were used in the study: one laboratoryadapted strain (PR8) and three H5N1 strains. Commercially available pasteurized whole milk (% fat) was spiked with virus strains at a concentration of 108 50% tissue culture infectious dosemL of milk or Optimized Minimum Essential Medium (OptiMEM) control media. The samples were subjected to three distinct heat treatments: 63 C for 30 minutes, 72 C for 20 seconds, and 91 C for 20 seconds. Different volumes of the spiked samples (200  L, 20  L, and 2  L) were used to assess how volume might influence the effectiveness of heat treatments. Additionally, the PR8 strain was tested in both pasteurized and unpasteurized milk to examine the impact of preheating milk at 37 C for 1 minute before exposure to HTST conditions. After the heat treatments, the samples were adjusted to a final volume of 200  L and titrated to determine viral viability.  Humantohuman transmission of H5N1 remains rare, but the virus is regarded as a significant pandemic threat. The researchers found no significant difference in viral titers between influenza viruses diluted in control media and those diluted in milk. All three viruses tested PR8, VN04  H5N1, and tyIN22 behaved similarly. However, it is essential to emphasize that these findings are based on controlled laboratory settings, which may not fully capture the complexities of realworld dairy processing. Heat treatment at 63 C for 30 minutes effectively decreased viral viability below the limit of detection. At 72 C for 20 seconds, titer reduction was inversely proportional to the sample volume, with a nonsignificant decrease in 200  L samples, but significant reduction in 20  L and 2  L samples. A similar trend was observed with treatment at 91 C for 20 seconds, where smaller sample volumes showed greater viral inactivation. Preheating the samples to 37 C for 1 minute before applying HTST conditions accelerated viral inactivation, particularly in smaller volumes. The study further explored the impact of different types of milk and storage temperatures on virus stability. Pasteurized, unpasteurized colostrum and mature milk were spiked with viruses and stored at different temperatures for up to four days. The viruses remained infectious for more than four days in unpasteurized milk at temperatures below 63 C, where viral inactivation occurred within 24 hours. Unpasteurized colostrum milk showed enhanced viral inactivation, possibly due to the presence of immunoglobulins, which provide a natural defense. Stability of influenza A in retail and unpasteurized milk. We diluted influenza A viruses in either OptiMem control media (Fisher Scientific, https:www.fishersci.com) (A), retail offtheshelf pasteurized whole milk (B), or 2 different sources of unpasteurized milk: colostrum milk (C) or mature milk (D). We then incubated 200 L samples for several days at various temperatures, as shown. We subsequently titrated samples by TCID50 in MDCK cells. We tested 3 strains: PR8 (H1N1), tyIN22 (H5N1), and the reverse genetics version of TX24 (H5N1). Unpasteurized colostrum milk produced during the first few days after birth contains high levels of immunoglobulins and antimicrobial peptides that might have had an effect in decreasing virus survival. PR8 (H1N1), wildtype strain APuerto Rico81934 (H1N1); RT, room temperature; TCID50, 50% tissue culture infectious dose; TX24, wildtype strain ATexas372024 (H5N1); tyIN22, wildtype highly pathogenic strain AturkeyIndiana37070032022 (H5N1). Nevertheless, a critical limitation is that spiking viruses into milk does not fully replicate the dynamics of a natural infection scenario. Enveloped viruses, such as influenza, are generally less stable than nonenveloped viruses, which have been more thoroughly studied in similar settings. This limitation underscores the need for further investigation into how viral inactivation in milk behaves under realworld conditions. Despite these findings, it is important to recognize that the presence of viral Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) in milk samples without viable viruses may be due to the sensitivity of modern detection methods rather than actual risk. Previous studies investigating HTSTlike temperature conditions have produced mixed results. For instance, one study found that complete viral inactivation occurred only at 105 C, whereas another study demonstrated total inactivation using HTST conditions. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of viral resilience under varying thermal conditions. The current study adds valuable insight but must be interpreted in the context of these prior findings, emphasizing the importance of further research in this area. The evidence indicates that HTST pasteurization can effectively inactivate the influenza virus, reducing the risk in milk supplies. However, due to the experimental limitations discussed earlier, caution is still warranted, and definitively ruling out the presence of live virus may require multiple blind passages in eggs, as is standard in surveillance studies. The study s findings, particularly with the PR8 strain, could serve as a valuable reference for evaluating commercial pasteurization processes. Nonetheless, the study highlights that further realworld testing is essential to ensure the robustness of these processes under industry conditions. Understanding the factors influencing virus survival in milk will help guide interventions to improve milk safety and address concerns about emerging viral threats. To summarize, the study demonstrates that pasteurization at standard temperatures, such as 63 C for 30 minutes and 72 C for 20 seconds, can reduce the viability of H5N1 in milk, particularly in smaller volumes. However, the study s limitations regarding experimental conditions and previous conflicting data must be considered. Viral inactivation was more pronounced in smaller sample volumes and enhanced by preheating. Additionally, the resilience of the virus in unpasteurized milk underscores the importance of vigilant heat treatment processes in commercial dairy practices.

It s already drawing in new visitors, but reaching prepandemic numbers is still a challenge. The real question is: can they keep travelers coming back? These relaxed visa rules are a great start, but turning them into longterm success will take more effort.          Peden Doma Bhutia     Select a question above or ask something else China has expanded its visafree entry policy to include citizens from Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, and Slovenia, allowing them to visit for up to 15 days without a visa. This move is part of a larger effort to revitalize its tourism industry, which is still recovering from the pandemic. The policy now extends to 18 European countries and aims to attract more tourists by simplifying the travel process. Although foreign tourist numbers have increased significantly, they remain below prepandemic levels, highlighting the ongoing challenges in reviving China's tourism sector. China has now announced visafree entry for citizens of 5 countries   Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, and Slovenia starting October 15. With this move, nationals from these countries can now visit China for up to 15 days without needing a visa. The expansion builds on a broader push by China to attract more foreign tourists and boost its tourism sector, which is still struggling to return to prepandemic levels. China s visafree policy now extends to 18 European countries, including earlier additions such as Norway in September and Poland in July. This gradual expansion signals a strategic effort to lure more European tourists back to the mainland. Citizens of these countries can enter without a visa, a perk extended until December 31, 2025, following an initial trial period that began last November. Our daily coverage of the global travel industry. Written by editors and analysts from across Skift s brands. China first announced this scheme in November last year for citizens from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. More countries have been added to the list since the beginning of this year. China s broader 144hour visafree transit policy now covers 37 ports and applies to citizens from 54 countries, including the U.S., Canada, and the UK. This transit policy allows travelers to stay for up to six days in specific regions without a visa if they have onward travel plans. On inbound travel to China, Trip.com CEO and Director Jane Sun, noted during the latest earnings call that visitors from visafree countries have surged by 190% over the same period in the AprilJune quarter. China s relaxed entry rules come at a crucial time for its tourism industry. From January to July 2024, the country attracted  million foreign tourists   a 130% increase compared to 2023. The influx is expected to contribute over CNY 100 billion (approximately $14 billion) in consumer spending, with average daily spending nearing CNY 3,459 ($485).  Yet, despite the impressive growth, these numbers fall short of the  million international visitors that China welcomed in 2019, when tourism revenue hit $ billion. Visafree entries are not just about simplifying the travel process   they are part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate China s standing as a tourism hub. From January to June 2024, the country recorded over  million visafree entries, accounting for 58% of all inbound travel. This marked a 190% increase compared to last year, underscoring the impact of streamlined entry policies. The National Immigration Administration (NIA) highlighted the influence of these policies on both inbound and outbound travel. With the implementation of preferential policies such as mutual visa exemptions and the 144hour visafree transit, there has been a rise in the number of trips by both Chinese citizens and foreign visitors, the NIA noted in its September report. Latest data from the MidAutumn Festival holiday offers a glimpse into the impact of China s visafree strategy. Border inspection authorities facilitated  million exits and entries during the holiday period, including 554,000 trips by foreign nationals   a 62% yearonyear increase. Chinese citizens also made  million trips in and out of the country during this time, reflecting a 15% growth compared to last year. Have a confidential tip for Skift?

Supreme Court Half Yearly Digest 2024  Criminal Minor Acts Supreme Court Half Yearly Digest 2024  Civil Minor Acts 6 Oct 2024 1:30 PM The National  Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Principal Bench, New Delhi comprising Mr.  Justice Ashok Bhushan (Chairperson), Mr. Barun Mitra (Technical Member) and Mr.  Arun Baroka (Technical Member) in an important judgment observed that  initiation of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against a  coborrower is allowed under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In the  present case, an appeal was filed by a suspended director of Narang Developers  Pvt. Ltd. (NDPL) against decision of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)  Mumbai which admitted the NDPL into insolvency on an application filed by  Aditya Birla Finance Ltd. (Financial Creditor) under section 7 of the IBC. Brief  Facts The loan  amount to the tune of Rs.  crores was advanced by financial creditor to  corporate debtor with NDPL acting as a coborrower. The terms and conditions of  the loan were enumerated in the letters sanctioned on September 19, 2016,  December 4, 2018. Subsequently, a facility agreement and a supplementary  facility agreement were also executed on September 29, 2016 and December 7,  2018 respectively. An indenture  of mortgage was executed on October 17, 2016 in which a security interest over  its assets was created by the NDPL in favour of the financial creditor. Account  of the corporate debtor was classified as NonPerforming Assets (NPA) on June  16, 2019 when it defaulted in paying the loan amount. Thereafter a demand  notice under section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act was sent on July 5, 2019. The  financial creditor moved an application under section 7 of the IBC before the  NCLT and CIRP was initiated against the corporate debtor on March 28, 2024.  This decision of the NCLT was challenged by the suspended director of the NDPL  before the NCLAT on the ground that the loan was provided directly to Csango  Industries Pvt. Ltd and Pacific Link Pvt Ltd. and not to NDPL therefore the  NDPL was not responsible for any default. Issue  Before NCLAT Whether a  Coborrower is equally and severally liable under a loan agreement with that of  the primary borrower. NCLAT's  Analysis The NCLAT  observed that coborrower shares equal and same liability under a loan  agreement with that of the primary borrower. It relied on the case of State  Bank of India vs Athena Energy Venture Pvt. Ltd.in which it was held that  CIRP can be initiated against both primary borrower and coborrower as similar  and equal responsibility is shared by them. The tribunal stated as under:  It is pertinent to point out that this Tribunal in the  matter of State Bank of India Vs Athena  Energy Venture Pvt Ltd. in CA(AT)(Ins)  No. 633 of 2020 has held that with the coming into force of Act 26 of 2018,  under the amended Section 60(2) and 60(3), CIRP can proceed against the  Principal Borrower as well as Guarantor. The said judgment held that IBC has no  aversion to simultaneously proceeding against the Corporate Debtor as Principal  Debtor and Corporate Guarantor. Therefore, when the Principal Borrower and  Guarantor have coextensive liabilities, we see no reason as to why CIRP  proceedings cannot be initiated against a CoBorrower who has equal and similar  liabilities with that of the Primary Borrower under a Facility Agreement which  has been jointly signed and executed as in the present factual matrix . The NCLAT further observed that:  The obligation of the CoBorrower is coextensive and  coterminous with that of the Primary Borrower and hence a right or cause of action  becomes available to the financial creditor to proceed against the primary  borrower, as well as the CoBorrower in equal measure in case they commit  default in repayment of the amount of debt . It was  further contended by the appellant that the loan documents were not properly  stamped which rendered them invalid. This plea was rejected by the NCLAT by  observing that insufficiently stamped documents do not render an agreement  invalid. It is merely a technical defect which can be rectified. The tribunal  relied on the landmark judgment of NN  Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. vs Indo Unique Flame Ltd delivered by the  Supreme Court in which it was held that an instrument is not void just because  it has not been properly stamped. However, it is not admissible until it is  properly stamped. The tribunal stated as under:  Insufficient stamping is only a technical deficiency which  is curable. It has been held by a 7 Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in Curative Petition (C) No. 44 of 2023 while dealing with a constitution bench  decision of 5 Judges of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in NN Global Mercantile (P) Ltd. Vs Indo Unique Flame Ltd.  (2024) 6 SCC 1 that nonstamping or  improper stamping does not result in the instrument becoming invalid. The  effect of not paying duty or paying an inadequate amount renders an instrument  inadmissible and not void. Hence, we are of the firm view that admission of  Section 7 application cannot be obfuscated by raising specious technical  pleas . The NCLAT  further observed that declaration of NPA under SARFAESI Act is an independent  proceeding which cannot obstruct the financial creditor from initiating CIRP  against the corporate debtor under the IBC. The tribunal held as under:  Furthermore, declaration of account as NPA under the  SARFAESI Act is an independent proceeding and cannot be adopted as a defence to  obstruct the Financial Creditor from proceeding under IBC to initiate CIRP  against the Corporate Debtor . The NCLAT  further noted that the loan facility was advanced at an annual interest of 15  percent therefore it is the loan provided against the time value of money.  Thus, the argument of the appellant that it does not qualify as a financial  debt under section 5(8) of the IBC does not have much force. Conclusion The NCLAT  concluded that several documents were signed by the corporate debtor in their  capacity as coborrower which also included signing of a demand promissory note  in which equal and same responsibility was shared for the loan amount given to  them by the financial creditor. Therefore, they cannot now refuse to repay the  loan amount. The tribunal concluded that:  In view of the foregoing discussions, the Hon'ble  Appellate Tribunal does not find any error in the judgment of the Adjudicating  Authority admitting the Section 7 application .

      "4 Slovak Prime Minister Fico Signals Possible Shift in Foreign Policy with Planned Visit to Russia - EU Today FICO  Summary:  Slovak Prime Minister Fico has expressed a desire to maintain positive relations with both Ukraine and Russia. Despite Ukraine's EU integration and Russia's aggressive actions, Fico has hinted at improving ties with Russia. This has raised concerns among EU leaders, who have distanced themselves from Russia due to its actions in Ukraine. Fico's approach is seen as an attempt to balance Slovakia's energy dependencies and geopolitical alliances, maintaining ties with both Kyiv and Moscow. Slovakia's energy dependency on Russia persists, with Gazprom playing a crucial role in the country's energy security. Fico's potential participation in Russia's Victory Day celebrations could be seen as a departure from Slovakia's commitment to the Western bloc's unified stance on Russia, raising questions about the implications for Slovakia's standing within the EU and NATO.\n",

      "23 Pasteurization effectively reduces H5N1 virus in milk but further testing is essential - News-Medical.Net Further  Summary:  Researchers evaluated the resilience of the H5N1 virus in milk under pasteurizationlike temperatures and assessed the effectiveness of thermal inactivation. The study found that some virus strains remained resilient, highlighting the need for further testing to ensure safety in commercial milk supplies. Pasteurization, a widely used method to ensure milk safety, involves heating milk to eliminate harmful bacteria. However, recent studies have shown conflicting results regarding the efficacy of pasteurizationlike conditions, indicating that unpasteurized milk from H5N1infected cows may contain sufficient virus to infect susceptible animals. The study demonstrated that pasteurization at standard temperatures, such as 63 C for 30 minutes and 72 C for 20 seconds, can reduce the viability of H5N1 in milk, particularly in smaller volumes. However, the study's limitations regarding experimental conditions and previous conflicting data must be considered.\n",

In the case of Amit Narang v. Aditya Birla Finance Ltd., the NCLAT held that the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) can be initiated against a coborrower who has equal and similar liabilities with that of the primary borrower. The tribunal also rejected the argument that the loan documents were not properly stamped, stating that insufficient stamping is only a technical deficiency that can be rectified. The NCLAT further held that the declaration of a loan as NonPerforming Assets (NPA) under the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI Act) is an independent proceeding that cannot obstruct the financial creditor from initiating CIRP against the corporate debtor under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

Despite Ukraine's EU integration and Russia's aggressive actions, Fico has hinted at improving ties with Russia. This has raised concerns among EU leaders, who have distanced themselves from Russia due to its actions in Ukraine. Fico's approach is seen as an attempt to balance Slovakia's energy dependencies and geopolitical alliances, maintaining ties with both Kyiv and Moscow. Slovakia's energy dependency on Russia persists, with Gazprom playing a crucial role in the country's energy security. Fico's potential participation in Russia's Victory Day celebrations could be seen as a departure from Slovakia's commitment to the Western bloc's unified stance on Russia, raising questions about the implications for Slovakia's standing within the EU and NATO.\n",
